# Payloads
These are some Payloads I have made, modified and used. Each folder contains all parts needed to replicate an attack.

NOTE: 
All executable files are created for my personal use only. 
If you would like to replicate the program, use the plain-text and supplement files to adjust to your own use and compile it yourself. 

DISCLAIMER:
These programs are for educational use only.
I do not condone illegal activities.
Do not use without express permission from information system owners/admins.
